Vector/List/Set performance for positional delete and unique insertion
==========

Results are HTML graphs. Open with your favorite web browser, or compile/run the code.

Three macros control the tests that get run:
     - VLM_SIZE => define to an integer. Default 1,000,000 (warning: takes a long time)
     - VLM_INSERTION => define to test unique insertion time
     - VLM_DELETION => define to test positional delete

Example compilation command:
     - `g++ -std=c++14 -O3 -o vlm_performance -DVLM_SIZE=1000 -DVLM_INSERTION`

You can then pass arguments to the executable.
     - -s => number of samples to generate (should be small for high VLM_SIZE)
     - -r => reporter type. Takes html, junit, or csv
	 - -o => output file
	 - For more ways to call the compiled executable and get different output results, see: https://nonius.io/ 
	 
Example run command:
    main.cpp ./vlm_performance -s 10 -r html -o "vlm_performance - x64 Bench.html"
